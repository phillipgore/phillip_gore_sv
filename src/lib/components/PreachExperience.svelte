        <h3>Preaching Minister</h3>
        <h4 class="cl-danger">Thousand Oaks Christian Church | San Antonio, Texas</h4>
        <p class="m-tn-b-12"> Thousand Oaks has a long history of problems. When I started, the church had been in a 6 month decline. Attendance had fallen to at least 35 (no records were being kept). A year later there had been 9 baptisms and we had an average attendance (ytd) of 68 heading into the fall.</p>

        <p class="m-tn-b-12">Many needed changes flowed from the establishment of a new mission and vision. We started an age-graded childrenâ€™s ministry on Sunday mornings. We transitioned from a Wednesday night Bible study with an attendance of 10 adults to Neighborhood based Small Groups with an attendance of 30-40 adults each week. We also established 5 Ministry Coordinators (Property, Hospitality, Children, Music, Communication) and recruited around 40 volunteers based on their gifting to serve in a specific area of ministry.</p>

        <p class="m-tn-b-12">A website was created, classrooms were cleaned up, painted, the floors were refinished and the landscaping around the building was repaired and upgraded.</p>

        <h3>Minister to Adults</h3>
        <h4 class="cl-danger">Christ's Church | Jacksonville, Florida</h4>
        <p class="m-tn-b-12">For the first year and a half I worked for the Campus Minister at the Church's Fleming Island location. I did the preaching, followed up with first time guests, designed and maintained the church's website and planned the services with the worship minister. Shortly after my arrival, the church launched in its new facilities and the attendance grew from 200 to 680.</p>

        <p class="m-tn-b-12">I then transferred to the Mandarin Campus to work with the Adult Ministry Team. I reworked and taught the Membership Class. I worked with the team to develop and lead Growth Groups: a six week, discussion-based study that helps new people connect, grow and serve at Christ's Church. I was responsible for baptisms, answering questions and making arrangements as well as coordinating and leading our baptism ministry volunteers. During this time there were over 700 baptisms at Christ's Church.</p>

        <p class="m-tn-b-12">Over the summer of 2010 Christ's Church prepared to offer Wednesday night programing for the first time in ten years. I led in organizing elective classes for adults. When we launched, we had over 350 adults participating. By the fall of 2011 that number had grown to over 500. I regularly taught 2 to 3 times a week and often preached weekends when the lead minister was absent.</p>

        <h3>Co-Preaching Minister</h3>
        <h4 class="cl-danger">Heartland Community Church | North Liberty, Iowa</h4>
        <p class="m-tn-b-12">Heartland was originally a Nazarene Church Plant. When I first met the lead planter, he was interested in the church leaving the denomination and going Independent. He knew that I was part of an independent fellowship and was curious. Two years later the church left the denomination and I was brought on staff as Co-Minister of the church.</p>
        
        <p class="m-tn-b-12">While on Staff at Heartland, I taught the Christian Basics Classes, led the small group development and preached 65% of the Sundays. I also organized a fundraising campaign to establish a property/building fund with a base goal of $40,000. It exceeded that goal by bringing in $43,000. My tenure at Heartland was dependent upon outside financial support which was only available for a year.</p>

        <p class="m-tn-b-12">I served as the lead planter of Encounter. It was a unique effort in church planting. We launched with two locations from the beginning, Coralville and Cedar Rapids, Iowa. It was a cold start with no pre-existing core group.</p>
        
        <p class="m-tn-b-12">During my tenure we grew from 3 (my family at the time) to a peak attendance of 80. I preached, developed and taught our Christian Basics Class, recruited and organized volunteers, helped develop our Small Group Leadership Training material and led and multiplied small groups.</p>

        <h4 class="cl-danger">Central Christian College | Moberly, Missouri</h4>
        <p class="m-tn-b-12">As a Director of Development I was involved in fundraising on a number of levels. I participated in campaign dinners and made personal calls on donors. I traveled the country for five months making presentations to church boards and missions' committees about the college's transition to the Full Tuition Scholarship Model. I worked on several fundraising efforts. And I also prepared two presentations about the college, one written and the other in power point, as well as guidelines and a video to help train those making board presentations.</p>

        <p class="m-tn-b-12">During my tenure funds were raised for a new heating and cooling system which was installed. A mission statement was written and applied. The board was reorganized. An outreach committee was instituted. A new members class was started, which I prepared and taught. 53 were baptized. And attendance grew from an average of 164 the year before I arrived to 201 my last year.</p>
