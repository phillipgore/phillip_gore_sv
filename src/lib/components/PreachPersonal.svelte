    <p class="pg-br-inside-avoid m-tn-b-18">I was raised in a Christian home on a farm in northeastern Missouri. During my youth I became a Christian and decided to enter the preaching ministry.</p>
    
    <p class="pg-br-inside-avoid m-tn-b-18">Upon graduating Central Christian College of the Bible, I served in occupational ministry for 16 years. For the past 10 years I have worked in web application development. But I have continued to preach and teach on a volunteer basis.</p>
    
    <p class="pg-br-inside-avoid">My wife Lanaya and I have been married for 23 years. We have two daughters, Elizabeth (22) and Phoebe (19), and two sons, Jonathan (22) and Harrison (15).</p>
